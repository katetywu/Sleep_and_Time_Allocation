# Sleep and Time Allocation
## Introduction
The project is inspired by [Sleep and the allocation of Time (Biddle et al.).](https://www.nber.org/papers/w2988) Authors applied aggregated data from 12 countries including the cross-section of microeconomic data, and a panel of households. They found that an increased in time spent in the labor market will decrease the time of sleeping. The purpose of this project is to figure out what variables in the dataset have the better explanation power of the model to do the prediction. The data used here is provided by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and details about each variable are listed [here](https://github.com/katetywu/Sleep_and_Time_Allocation/blob/master/sleep_VarDes.pdf).
