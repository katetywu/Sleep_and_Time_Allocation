They found that an increased in time spent in the labor market will decrease the time of sleeping. The purpose of this project is to figure out what variables in the dataset have the better explanation power of the model to do the prediction. The data used here is provided by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and details about each variable are listed [here](#).
